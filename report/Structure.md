We have x problem, splatter image does y
Splatter  image not great, we improve by feeding additional geometry priors.
We consider these originally (full list)
Then we dropped down to these options: SELECTION
This is as (say stuff like why not planes, why normal maps, etc.)
We use X as datasets
We perform model selection on said datasets using these metrics.
Results: We pick these models for these priors.

We modify the single image model.
Architecture changes, this is now multimodal data. 
We have limited compute. 
As such we perform: First layer swap. FiLM layers.
Discuss above two in depth. Explain choice of FiLM model. Discuss Dropout here or in eariler priors
We could also do: Control Net, Transform, this is how we would do these, but no time/compute.

These are metrics we use to judge model.
We perform ablation study.
Results.

Future improvements
