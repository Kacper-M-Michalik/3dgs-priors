The data here (in the rgb and depth folders within 'shapenet-variation-data') is a subset from the images contained within https://github.com/Xharlie/ShapenetRender_more_variation/ 

These are accessed in a different way within the notebook; data is here as reference, for the specific images used. (Will return to this and fix paths).
